# Timer
 Basic Timer

 This is a simple and lightweight timer application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows you to set a timer for a custom amount of time in minutes and seconds, and provides various controls to manage the timer.


Input Fields

    Minutes: Use the up and down arrows to set the minutes.
    Seconds: Use the up and down arrows to set the seconds.

Buttons

    Start Timer: Starts the timer with the specified minutes and seconds.
    Pause Timer: Pauses the currently running timer.
    Reset Timer: Resets the timer to the initial input values (the values before the timer was started).
    Restart Timer: Stops the current timer and starts a new one with the previous input values.
    Stop Timer: Stops the current timer and sets the timer values to 0.

Checkboxes

    Auto Restart: When checked, the timer will automatically restart with the previous values after it finishes.
    Always on Top: Keeps the timer window always on top of other windows.


You can change the sound that plays by dropping a different sound file in the sound folder and renaming it alert.mp3
